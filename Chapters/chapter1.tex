\section{Context and Motivation}
    
The KLx Employee Management System, AnA, is a tool for the automation of the IGA process, which manages more than 5000 employees from the Credit Agricole group. The software was developed by an external editor named Netwrix and then bought on-premises by the Leasing and Factoring branch of the group. The software's end users are the managers from the global Human Resources team and was deployed to production in 2020.

Since then, the KLx team in Lisbon has worked to maintain the application and upgrading it to meet the needs and requirements that are requested by the Functional team in France, which, in turn, takes its orders from the human resources department.

However, the complexity of the system has increased over time. The integration of more departments into the software and the changes taking place in the environment were aggravating. This made all changes needed more difficult and the cost to maintain the system increases. The work is motivated by a realization that the quality of the code, along with its engineering process, determines the efficiency and effectiveness of the system.

In these situations, the theories and methodologies of Software Quality becomes essential. The intention is to identify some critical points of improvement in the solution and in the development workflow. By using making use of these methods, we intend to achieve a better software and developing system.

\section{Problem Definition}

Besides all the mentioned problems, one thing that marks the codebase is the fact that before the KLx team were created, the objective of the CA was to hire the software editor to do the configuration of the application based on the requirements of the Human Resources. But this was not possible due to the lack of understanding on how the IGA workflow would work, leading to a model misspecification. 

Additionally, at the present, the source code consists of about 20,000 lines spread over 200 files that are not maintained under any versioning control system. The codebase and it's backups are stored in shared servers where the different environments of the application runs. This workflow has led to mistakes that could have been avoided with the safety and organisation provided by a good development model.

More on, a brief review of the source code also revealed some recurrent issues related to the quality of the code, in this case, code duplication. Since there are pretty frequent changes in business, for each change, the time lost in complexity increase every iteration. These, in turn, have introduced several bad engineering practices into the developing system.

The problems our team experiences are related to bad practices an a absence of a Software Quality orientation. Finding and implementing these practices will thus not only improve the quality of the code but also the entire delivery process. In the future, effective ways need to be found to solve these issues.

\section{Main Contributions}

One of my key responsibilities is the analysis of the modules Profiles and Notifications. This involves a deep review of requirements and the creation of alternative representation models to enhance the understanding.

I am currently creating a specification of the application profiles and permissions using a new organizational matrix. This significantly helped us to see where code could be factorised during our further developments. Ensuring precise permissions is crucial for maintaining both security and functionality.

Additionally, I am enhancing our version control practices by implementing GIT. I have documented this methodology to ensure its effectiveness. Furthermore, I am leading our team through the transition to this new system, ensuring a smooth adoption. Our progress includes phases such as code cleanup, repository setup, script variabilization and training.

In collaboration with stakeholders, I am actively involved in the development of new features and integrations across various technologies, including PowerShell, C, XML, JSON, and SQL. Upcoming major projects include the integration of the L684 SAS Server application (manual + AD provisioning) and the L716-SIMPLISSIMO application (manual provisioning).
