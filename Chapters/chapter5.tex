\chapter{Work Plan}
\label{Work Plan}

This chapter presents the structured work plan designed to guide the execution of tasks for achieving the project's objectives.

\section{Refactoring the Codebase}

Refactoring the codebase improves software maintainability and efficiency. The process starts with reviewing current profiles and permissions, identifying code duplication, and documenting the existing state. A new matrix for profiles and permissions is then designed to simplify the structure and reduce redundancy. Stakeholders validate this design to ensure it meets project requirements. Implementation involves updating the codebase to match the new structure, with peer reviews and testing to ensure quality. Addressing anomalies in the permission catalog involves documenting issues, investigating causes, and making necessary corrections. These corrections are tested to ensure the permission system works as required.

\section{Gantt Chart with Tasks}

The work plan includes a Gantt chart illustrating the timeline and dependencies of each task. This visual representation facilitates project management by outlining key milestones, task durations, and critical paths. It serves as a dynamic tool for monitoring progress and ensuring adherence to project timelines.
