The KLx Employee Management System, AnA, is essential for automating the Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) process within the Credit Agricole group, managing over 5000 employees. Developed by Netwrix and implemented at the CA Leasing and Factoring branch in 2018, this system has grown increasingly complex due to the integration of various departments and continuous environmental changes. This complexity has resulted in maintenance challenges, code quality issues, and inefficiencies in the delivery process.

This thesis addresses these challenges by improving code readability and maintainability, implementing Git for version control, and streamlining deployment processes using GitLab. Significant contributions include refactoring key modules, developing a new organizational matrix for application profiles and permissions, and integrating new features using PowerShell, C, XML, JSON, and SQL. These efforts aim to enhance system performance, facilitate future maintenance, and ensure the long-term reliability of the KLx Employee Management System, AnA.
