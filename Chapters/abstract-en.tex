The KLx employee and application management system is a tool for automating Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) processes. The main objective of this thesis is to contribute to improve the quality of the code, proposing optimizations in some functions/ blocks of code and also extend its capabilities to connect with other applications of the group, including the implementation of all/some of the proposals. The thesis will propose and give the necessary information to implement some enhancements and extensions, such as: Refactoring some sets of the codebase in some module to eliminate code smells and improve readability and maintainability; Implement version control with GIT to track and manage code changes; Automate the deployment of the application in the several environments used with GITLAB; Develop new features and integrations, demanded by the stakeholders, with other applications using technologies such as PowerShell, \Verb!C#!, XML, JSON, and SQL.
