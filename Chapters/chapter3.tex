\section{Restructuring and Refactoring}

"Refactoring is the art of improving the design of existing code. Refactoring provides us with ways to recognize problematic code and gives us recipes for improving it." \cite{wake2004refactoring} 

\cite{Refactoring2020} \cite{30yearsSoftwareRefactoring2020} \cite{smellsRefactoring2020} \cite{RefactoringFowler2002} \cite{SurveyRefactoring2004} \cite{estructuringArnold1989}

\subsection{Explanation and Goals}
An intrinsic property of software in a real-world environment is its need to evolve. As the software is enhanced, modified, and adapted to new requirements, the code becomes more complex and drifts away from its original design, thereby lowering the quality of the software. As a result, a significant portion of the total software development cost is devoted to software maintenance, which includes repairing design and implementation faults, adapting software to new environments, and adding or modifying functionalities. Despite advances in software development methods and tools, these improvements often lead to increased complexity as more new requirements are implemented within the same timeframe.

To cope with this spiral of complexity, there is an urgent need for techniques that reduce software complexity by incrementally improving the internal software quality. The research domain that addresses this problem is referred to as restructuring. In object-oriented software development, this practice is specifically known as refactoring. According to Chikofsky and Cross , restructuring is defined as "the transformation from one representation form to another at the same relative abstraction level, while preserving the subject system’s external behavior (functionality and semantics)." This process often involves altering code to improve its structure without introducing new functionalities but may lead to better observations that suggest beneficial changes.

The term "refactoring" was first introduced by William Opdyke in his PhD dissertation, which described refactoring as "the process of changing a [object-oriented] software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code, yet improves its internal structure". The key idea is to redistribute classes, variables, and methods across the class hierarchy to facilitate future adaptations and extensions.

\subsection{Effects}
In the context of software evolution, refactoring and restructuring are used to improve various software quality attributes such as extensibility, modularity, reusability, complexity, maintainability, and efficiency. These techniques are also employed in reengineering, which involves examining and altering a subject system to reconstitute it in a new form and subsequently implementing this new form. This process is essential for converting legacy or deteriorated code into a more modular or structured form  and for migrating code to different programming languages or paradigms.

Studies have shown that refactoring can significantly reduce developers' time and assist in detecting, fixing, and reducing software bugs. Research by Mens et al. provided an overview of the impact of refactoring on software processes, comparing different approaches and their effects on attributes like maintainability and testability. Refactoring has also been linked to reducing technical debt and mitigating the negative impact of code smells on software maintainability and evolution.

\subsection{Methods, Approaches, and Instruments}
Refactoring typically involves several distinct activities, including identifying areas of the software that need improvement, determining appropriate refactoring methods, ensuring that refactoring preserves the system's behavior, applying the refactoring, assessing the impact on quality characteristics, and maintaining consistency between the refactored code and other software artifacts such as documentation and design documents. Various tools and techniques support these activities, aiding developers in systematically improving code quality.

Research has monitored projects on platforms like GitHub to identify refactoring activities and understand the contexts in which they occur. Interviews and surveys with developers have revealed common refactoring practices, such as method extraction, which is often motivated by the need to support new feature development. Other studies, such as those by Elish et al., have proposed classifications of refactoring methods based on their measurable effects on software quality attributes. Additionally, tools for detecting code smells and supporting refactoring have been extensively reviewed, providing valuable insights for practitioners and researchers.

\subsection{Challenges and Recommended Approaches}
Despite the frequent application of refactoring, understanding the composition and sequence of refactoring operations based on developers' intentions remains challenging. Developers often struggle to justify time spent on refactoring when the functionality remains unchanged. However, refactoring is a crucial investment for future development, particularly for long-lived software involving multiple developers. Studies have explored the motivations behind code changes and the introduction and removal of code smells, emphasizing the need for further research to identify best practices for maximizing the benefits of refactoring in software projects.

\subsection{Challenges and Best Practices}
Software maintenance is an essential activity, consuming 50 to 80 of total software costs, according to Welf Löwe and Panas (2005) and Telea and Voinea (2011). Maintenance tasks include repairing design and implementation faults, adapting software to different environments, and adding or modifying functionalities. One of the major challenges in maintenance is the lack of helpful documentation, making complex source code the primary reliable source of information about a system. Several studies have identified common pitfalls, anti-patterns, and code smells that negatively impact maintainability. Code smells, which are violations of coding design principles, increase technical debt and complicate software maintenance and evolution. Refactoring is essential for removing code smells and improving software quality. However, the process of detecting smells and applying appropriate refactorings remains challenging. Automated support for these tasks is crucial, as highlighted by Moha et al. (2010) and others.





\section{Reverse Engineering}
\cite{ReverseEngineering2011} \cite{ReverseEngineering2005} \cite{ReverseEngineering1990}

Reverse engineering in software engineering is the process of deconstructing software systems to understand their components, interactions, and design. This practice is critical for maintaining, analyzing, and improving legacy systems, ensuring they meet new requirements or are adapted to new environments.

\subsection{Techniques in Reverse Engineering}

Static analysis is the initial step in reverse engineering, focusing on examining the software's source code without executing it. Static analyzers parse the code, extract relevant information, and construct models that represent the software’s structure and behavior. Challenges include dealing with different programming language variants, non-compilable code, and the need to extract specific facts without building a complete Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Tools like Design Maintenance Systems (DMS) and island parsers help address these issues by parsing only the relevant fragments. When source code is unavailable, decompilation tools are used to convert binary code back into a higher-level language. Fact extractors such as Bauhaus and Columbus gather dependencies and metrics, while tools like CodeSurfer conduct semantic analyses, such as control dependence and data flow, to create detailed views of the software.

Dynamic analysis complements static analysis by examining the software during execution. It captures execution traces to gain insights into the system's runtime behavior, which static analysis cannot fully capture, such as pointer resolution and user interactions. Dynamic analysis involves instrumenting the program to collect execution data, which is then analyzed to identify patterns and operational profiles. Challenges include ensuring the program can be compiled and executed, selecting representative inputs, and managing large execution traces. Tools like Daikon analyze execution traces to identify invariants, and methods proposed by Hassan et al. filter traces to extract relevant information for specific tasks.

Historical analysis uses data from versioning systems, bug tracking systems, and other repositories to understand how software artifacts have evolved. It provides insights into when and why changes were made, who made them, and which artifacts were affected. Historical analysis complements static and dynamic analyses by offering a temporal perspective on software changes. Key challenges include integrating information from heterogeneous repositories, analyzing differences between software versions, and grouping related changes. Techniques for historical analysis often involve matching bug tracking IDs with versioning system commit notes and utilizing tools like ChangeDistiller to provide detailed change information.

\subsection{Key Concepts and Definitions}

In the context of software engineering, forward engineering and reverse engineering are fundamental concepts. Forward engineering refers to the traditional process of moving from high-level abstractions and logical, implementation-independent designs to the physical implementation of a system. This process follows a sequence from requirements through design to implementation.

Reverse engineering, in contrast, involves analyzing a system to identify its components and their interrelationships, creating representations of the system at a higher level of abstraction. It does not involve changing the subject system but aims to understand its structure and behavior. Reverse engineering can start at any level of abstraction or stage in the lifecycle, spanning from existing implementation to deciphering the requirements.

Key subareas of reverse engineering include redocumentation, design recovery, and restructuring. Redocumentation involves creating or revising a semantically equivalent representation at the same abstraction level, often using tools like pretty printers, diagram generators, and cross-reference listing generators. Design recovery goes beyond basic redocumentation by incorporating domain knowledge, external information, and fuzzy reasoning to recreate higher-level abstractions. Restructuring transforms one representation form to another at the same abstraction level while preserving the system's external behavior.


\section{Reengineering}
\cite{SoftwareEvolutionMens2008}

Reengineering is a comprehensive approach to examining and transforming existing software systems to meet new requirements or to improve their functionality and maintainability. This process is distinct from refactoring and restructuring as it often involves more extensive changes and may address broader aspects of the system, including its architecture and design principles.

\subsection{Reengineering Patterns}

Reengineering patterns provide structured methodologies to address common challenges in reengineering projects. These patterns encapsulate expert knowledge and proven practices, offering solutions that help navigate the complexities of modifying and enhancing software systems.

Reengineering patterns share similarities with general software design patterns. They are context-specific, addressing recurring issues in software reengineering by providing solutions that balance various trade-offs and forces. Patterns are typically documented using a template that includes sections for the problem context, solution, forces and trade-offs, examples, known uses, and related patterns. This structure aids engineers in managing complex reengineering tasks by breaking them down into more manageable parts and guiding them through each step of the problem-solving process.

\subsection{Refactoring and Reengineering Patterns}

Refactoring focuses on improving the internal structure of the code without altering its external behavior, while reengineering often involves more significant changes to align the system with new requirements or modern standards. Refactoring patterns provide specific techniques for incremental code improvement, whereas reengineering patterns offer strategies for more comprehensive system transformation.

Reengineering patterns extend beyond simple code refactoring. They guide engineers through substantial changes, such as migrating to new architectures or integrating new technologies. These patterns emphasize maintaining the functionality of the system while improving its underlying structures. For instance, the "Speculate About Design" pattern advocates creating and validating high-level design models against existing code, fostering a better understanding of the system and guiding future modifications.

\subsection{Pattern Systems and Languages}

Reengineering patterns are often organized into systems or languages that provide a cohesive framework for tackling complex reengineering tasks. A pattern system is a collection of related patterns that address different aspects of a problem, while a pattern language offers a more integrated approach, where patterns work together to achieve a comprehensive solution.

A pattern system breaks down a large reengineering task into smaller, manageable parts, each addressed by a specific pattern. For example, a pattern system for dealing with legacy code might include patterns for introducing unit tests, managing dependencies, and gradually refactoring code.

A pattern language, on the other hand, creates a tightly-knit group of patterns that collectively address a broad problem. This approach ensures that individual patterns integrate seamlessly, providing a holistic solution to the reengineering challenge. An example is the Temporal Details pattern language, which helps engineers manage the evolution of program representations over time by creating, refining, and integrating intermediate representations.

\subsection{Difficulties in Reengineering Patterns}

Reengineering patterns face several challenges that can impact their effectiveness and applicability. These difficulties include the lack of experience reports, the scarcity of recognized experts, and the absence of explicitly listed forces and trade-offs.

One major challenge is the lack of documented experience reports. Software designers often do not publish their reengineering experiences due to professional reluctance or non-disclosure agreements. This scarcity of documented cases makes it difficult to validate patterns through multiple known uses, a standard criterion in the pattern community. For instance, the Design Disharmonies pattern relies on examples from open-source projects like ArgoUML to gain credibility, as few designers publicly share their reengineering stories.

Another challenge is the scarcity of recognized experts in reengineering. This field is often viewed as less prestigious than forward engineering, leading to fewer experts being acknowledged. Effective reengineering requires a high level of expertise, encompassing all the skills needed for forward engineering plus additional reengineering-specific skills. Industrial sponsorship and recognition of reengineering expertise can help address this issue, as demonstrated by the Gold Mining pattern, which emphasizes the importance of tacit knowledge held by system maintainers.

Additionally, some reengineering patterns do not explicitly list the forces and trade-offs involved, leading to skepticism about their validity as true patterns. Despite this, works by authors like Fowler, Feathers, and Lanza are included in discussions of reengineering patterns because they convey expert knowledge and provide practical solutions using a template-like structure. The structured approach and vocabulary they offer are invaluable for discussing and addressing complex redesign challenges.

By leveraging reengineering patterns, pattern systems, and pattern languages, software engineers can effectively manage the complexity of reengineering tasks, ensuring that legacy systems are transformed into robust, modern, and maintainable forms. Addressing the inherent difficulties in reengineering patterns further enhances their applicability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
